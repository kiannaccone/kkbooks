# Reason for the project: 
  This project was built in order to apply and showcase the skills we have learned and developed during our phase two training at the Software Engineering Live class - FlatIron Bootcamp class of 09/21. These skills major in our use of React to build build a frontend with routes and fetch to the backend database of our project, and used React components to design the webpages. 

# Project Description: 
KK Book's is a safe haven for all book lovers. Want to browse books? Navigate to Book List to see all the book, search books, and filter books by genre. Want to add your favorite book to the Book List? Navigate to Add a Book to fill out a form so your lastest read can be someone else new read. Finally, if you have no idea what to read and are feeling a little spontaneous, go to Book Date to be recommended a random book from the list.

# Learnings and Struggles:
As a team, we struggled with the react form. It was a good experience because it made us figure out how to create something we have not done before. It taught us the importance of utilizing the web and React Docs. This project gave us the cofidence push oursleves into the unknown and that we will always "figure it out."

# Acknowledgments:
  We used numerous resources both from our curriculum and those available for free online. These allowed us to expand our knowledge and practice many new skills.
